			<h1>Project Name:</h1>
			<p>Finding Fido</p>
			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
			I want to redesign an app that I made two years ago during sophomore year. I named the app “Finding Fido”, and it was supposed to help college students find pet-friendly places around Harrisonburg.  For my independent project, I want to rebrand and redefine what Finding Fido is – instead of finding pet friendly places around Harrisonburg, I want the app to focus on helping young adults find and adopt animals in the US.<br>
			I will be conducting UX research (interviews, compiling interview data, creating design requirements, creating personas, wireframes, user story narratives, and visual design concepts) and will be creating both a low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD using the data/information I collected from the research to guide my design. I will also conduct usability testing at the high-fidelity prototype stage. I also created a logo/brand identity for the original app, which I will be revamping as well.<br>
			At the time of making the original app design, I used Axure XP to create the low-fidelity prototype. For the redesign, however, I want to use Adobe XD. I used XD last semester, but I would like to deepen my understanding of it and really become comfortable using it. 
			</p>
			<h1>Goals</h1>
			<p>
			The main goal for the app is to help young adults find and adopt animals. While in the process of designing the app, I want to avoid any pre-disposed bias and be more inclusive by taking the time to think about not only the people who use the app, but the animals being put up for adoption as well. Social desirability bias is common when it comes to adopting animals – I want to avoid that as much as possible by paying close attention to word choice/writing style. At the same time, I need to make sure that the “desired user” that I am designing for doesn’t become too narrow of a profile. Lastly, I aim to learn more about Adobe XD and become as comfortable as possible with it.
			</p>
			<h1>Audience</h1>
			<p>
			The target audience for my app is young adults. An average user would be in their twenties or thirties and have little to no experience with the process of adoption and may be first-time pet owners. They’re not sure where to start and may be overwhelmed with the whole idea, but they’re passionate about animals and want to know everything they can to be able to care for an animal of their own to the best of their ability.
